# Build a connect-4 game

The rules of the game are:

Players must connect 4 of the same colored discs in a row to win. This can be done horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
Only one piece is played at a time.
Players can be on the offensive or defensive.
The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate when all forty two slots are filled.
The starter of the previous game goes second in the next game.
 The board has 42 windows distributed in 6 rows and 7 columns.


Build a ‘create user form’ with the fields: Nickname, age. The form will appear in the beginning before the game is played and in case we already have a user we will not see the form again.



The game will start with a random player.



In the end of the game we will see a popup with the winners name and and two buttons: ‘Start a new game’ and ‘Go to the score board’ where

You will be able to see the scores of the games.  The score is a counter of how many moves did it take to finish the game.



On the scoreboard we will see the list of playing games with the fields: Winner, counter of moves and duration of the game in minutes and seconds.



During the game we need to be able to see who’s turn it is. The app should be built in react technology and typescript. All the other technologies and libraries are up to you. Thinking out of the box and creativity will be very appreciated!
