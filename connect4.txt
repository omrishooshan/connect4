                                    2.  activate genNewBoard() function to create a copy of the new board with the player token (red or yellow)=> inside this fun we add the token to the first undefined slot
                                    3. checking for a win using checkIfWinner() func => running 4 kinds of checks - vertical , horizontal , diaognal up, diognal down, in case of a win => the state will add the current player as the winner with a pop up to reset the game
                                    4. in case of no win player token will be added to the board and the current_player state will be replaced to the second player
